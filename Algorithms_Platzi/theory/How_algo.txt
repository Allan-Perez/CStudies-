Process/Methodology to create algorithms:
	1. Definition of the problem
	2. Analyze the problem
	3. Design an algorithm for the problem
	4. Verify the algorithm / test it, and if it doesn't work properly or doesn't work at all, optimize or change.


What data to export from the analysis of the problem:
	- What data does take as input 
	- What data does take as output
	- Types of data:
		- Numbers
		- Video
		- Image
		- Text
		- Audio
		- String


Run-time analysis is the relationship between the input and the time needed to get an output.
