We can classify algorithms in many different ways, and there are many ways to 
classify them:
	- Classified by function:
		- Sort 
		- Search
		- Routing: How information will be delivered

	- Classified by signs system:
		- Qualitative: Furniture manuals, cooking recipes, personal problem, ...
		- Quantitative: Mathematical formalizable problems (networks, GOFAI)

	- Computational algorithms: Algorithms for computers. They can be represented by:
		- Pseudocode
		- Programming languages
		- Natural language
		- (formal) Mathematics


Some of the features of algorithms:
	- Have to have a defined order.
	- Has to have a definition, and has to be deterministic (for the same input, always the same output).
		(even though there are other kind of algorithms that are called non-deterministic algorithms, that 
		doesn't follow this rule.)
	- Has to be defined by a finite number of steps, and a finite number of instructions
	- Has to solve one specific problem.
