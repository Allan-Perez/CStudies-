SQL (Postgres, Maria,...):
	- Structured language
	- Table-based
	- compatibility with other types of files
	- tree-based indexation (trunk ramified) (b+ trees)

NoSQL(cassandra, mongo,...):
	- Structured language
	- non structured language
	- different indexation (usually JSON)
	- horizontal growth (scale-out )

Analytics and big data (hadoop, spark, ...):
	- Non structured language
	- integration with a lot of systems
	- traditional systems and engagement (twitter, facebook, slack,...)
	- divide and conquer principle
	- scale-out based.

Acceleration-based (redis, neo4j, kinetica) :
	- in response to the inefficient tree-based indexation
	- usually in-memory (ultra-fast, but not persistent )
	- GPUs, flash-cards (faster than SSD), FPGAs, ...
	- usually Node-based 
	- usually in enterprise-environment and datawarehouse
	- this is useful in insurances, forensics,...

Ways of using:
	- Premise open source
	- licenciamiento por cores o sockets
	- licenciamiento modular
	- SAAS or PAAS
	- compute nodes subscription
