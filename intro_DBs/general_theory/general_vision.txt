what is data?
	- word
	- number
	- code
	- feature
	- transaction
	- image
	- ...
EASILY: something that will help to describe an object or a situation, an entity. 

Something worth to remind: data is not information. Data helps to store registers or 
describe entities, but it is useless. What is worth is the infromation, and a process
is requiered to turn data to information

Abstraction levels of a database:
	- Conceptual: I have to have clear what is the concept of my design. 
					Objects on a dataset:
						- Entities: Abstracted object, with features
						- Relation: How an object interacts with another object

	- Logical: This helps us to keep track of what is going on with our DB in a more 
			formal way, and can be useful because with this we can localize 
			deficiencies in our architecture, or redundancy, or non-normalization,...

	- Physcial: The data structures we use in each database and architecture, and how 
				can we make our DB to understand it.
