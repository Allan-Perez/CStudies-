History:
1950-1960: Tabulating machines, perfored cards, magnetic tapes.
1960-1970: hierarchy models, hard disks, relational models, real-time transactions.
1970-1980: Commercial SQL, parallel DBs, Object Oriented DBs
1980-1990: Data mining, data warehouse, e-commerce 

*Data mining and data warehouse born from the necessity of having 
information out of data. Because raw data is useless. Once you 
analyse, got some statistics, and communicate this information, then it is useful.*

2000-Present: XML, automated administration, analytics, big data, NoSQL
			  in-memory, scale-out, systems of engagement.

DBMS: Data Base Management Systems
