This model is helpful because this is like steps to take in order to 
properly create the database.

3 abstraction layers of our DB:
 	- Conceptual: This is to define our model rapidly, to express the <concept>
 	
 	- Logic: This is a pre-step for the transition between our concept and the 
 				and the actual implementation of our model for the DB.
 				This is helpful to define the <logic> of our model.
 				The feature is that the relationships between entities are 
 				changes, so that the M-M relationship (e.g. many streets can
 				handle many people, and many people can be in many streets) are 
 				related by a weak entity, which will inherit the identifiers 
 				of both strong entities, and have some attributes to define.
 				Also, the 1-M relationsip (e.g. 1 person has many clothes) 
 				is changed so that the entity with M relationship gets a 
 				foregin key from the entity with 1 relationship (e.g. the 
 				clothes have 1 proprietary)


 	- Physical: The only thing that changes here is the way we do write 
 				the diagram. Here we put names to the relationships.

 	Now, the physical version is the one that we will implement.
